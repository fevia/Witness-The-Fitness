# [Witness-the-Fitness](https://witness-the-fitness.herokuapp.com/)

## Description 
Witness-the-Fitness is an app designed to give the user two exercises chosen at random when they enter how many calories they want to burn. All exercises are designed to last 1 full hour. No two days will ever be the same!


## Installation
When you open the app, you will need to run 'npm i' to install the packages provided.
In your Mysql workbench, create the database "fitness_db". Now inside your integrated terminal, make sure to run 'npm run seeds' to give your database all the exercise data.

In the calorie goal box, input the amount of calories you want to burn in the span of one hour. If you would like to look at a list of all the exercises provided along with the amount of calories burned per lb, you can access it by the 'All Exercises' link at the top of the page.
